# @codecarvalho/aws-helper

Bundle of helpers for aws-sdk, just an idea for make helper to be useful and handle some cases for simplify developer life.

## Motivation

Sometimes we expected reduce a number of times we type the same code again and again. Some interfaces and usage of `aws-sdk`, and possible another set of aws tools, have a large number of use cases.

Principal idea here is solve that "issue" with some Helpers or Factories to reduce number of lines on my own code, maybe that are helpful for you too.

## What are included?
